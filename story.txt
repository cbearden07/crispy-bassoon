Jace stood at the edge of the balcony, the lights of the city lighting up the area around him as if it were daytime. He rested his hands on the railing in front of him and leaned forward casually, taking some of the weight off of his feet. The night was like any other, because here, nothing ever changed.

"I am free as a bird." Jace thinks to himself,free falling. At the very last moment of his life, he is finally starting to truly enjoy what he is doing. 

People who attended Jace's funeral were sad but happy for him since he has left a dying message "I am finally being myself."

Many years passed and Jace's family never forgot him. They would always believe in his happiness and that he found himself in the night that never changes.
